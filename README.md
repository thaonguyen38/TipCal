Submitted by: Thao Nguyen

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Slider to change the default tip percentage
- [X] Slider to change the number of people to split the bill
- [X] Display the amount each person has to pay

## Notes

I have never coded in Swift before so it is a completely new programming language to me. I'm also new to the working environment and layouts of XCode so it took a little while to get used to.
The components of the app are also not easy to keep track of. For example, all components have to respond accordingly to the change of other, I had to fix many bugs relating this issue when some label/field doesn't display what it should.
